# Molecule Viewer Web Application

## Project Description üìù

This molecule viewer web application allows you to view the molecular structures of molecules from uploaded SDF files. <br>
This web application has the following functionalities:
- Adding and removing elements.
- Upload your own molecule SDF files.
- Display the molecules.
- Rotate the molecules on x, y, and z axis to view the molecule from different angles.

## Usage üíª
NOTE: This web application was made to be used in University of Guelph's server. <br> makefile might need to be modified to run the application on your system. <br><br>
Enter the following in your terminal to run the program:

## Project Development üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

- Developed a C library to represent and manipulate the molecules.
- Wrote a python script to generate the SVG image of the molecule and implements the C library by using SWIG.
- Created a SQLite database to store data from the uploaded molecule SDF files.
- Built the front end using HTML/CSS and jQuery, as well as the server using Python HTTP.
